<p class="text-gray-700 text-center">Last Updated: March 12, 2019</p>
</section>
<section class="pt-4 pb-8">
<p class="text-gray-700">Welcome! DApps Platform, Inc., SIX DAYS LLC (“we,” “our,” or “us”) provides its services through its website located at trustwallet.com and related mobile applications and products (collectively the “Services” or “Trust Wallet”).
Before using our Services, please read the Terms of Service (the “Terms” or the “Agreement”) carefully, along with any other policies or notices on Trust Wallet’s website or mobile applications, and our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy).
Together, these materials contain terms, rules, and guidelines related to your use of Trust Wallet.
</p>
<h3 class="font-weight-bold">OVERVIEW</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700">We know that Terms can be long and confusing, so we will do our best to keep things as clear and concise as possible. This section provides a brief summary of the highlights of this Agreement. Please note that when you accept this Agreement,
you are accepting all of the terms and conditions and not just this section.
Trust Wallet provides self-hosted wallet services for Ethereum-based blockchains.
By creating or importing a wallet, downloading or running our mobile application, or visiting our website, you are agreeing to our Terms, so please read carefully.
These terms outline approved uses of Trust Wallet, various licenses that we grant to you, and licenses that you grant us.
If you have any questions or comments related to this Agreement, please send us a message on our website at <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8bf8fefbfbe4f9ffcbfff9fef8fffceae7e7eeffa5e8e4e6">[email&#160;protected]</a> or contact us through Discord, Facebook, Telegram, or Twitter.
If you do not agree to this Agreement or any modifications to this Agreement, you should not use our Services.
</p>
<h3 class="font-weight-bold">HOW YOU ACCEPT THIS POLICY</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700">By creating or importing a locally hosted wallet (a “Wallet”), or visiting our website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms, as well as the accompanying [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)
We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time. Any such changes with respect to your use of Trust Wallet will take effect immediately when posted on our website or on our mobile application. Your continued use of Trust Wallet following
any such change will signify your acceptance to be bound by the then current Terms. Please check the effective date above to determine if there have been any changes since you have last reviewed these Terms.
If you do not agree to this Agreement or any modifications to this Agreement, you should not use Trust Wallet.
Failure or delay by Trust Wallet in enforcing or partially enforcing any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights.
</p>
<h3 class="font-weight-bold">ELIGIBILITY</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700">To be eligible to use Trust Wallet, you must be at least eighteen (18) years old and be able to form legally binding contracts.
If you are using our Services on behalf of a legal entity, you further represent and warrant that: (a) the legal entity is duly organized and validly existing under the applicable laws of the jurisdiction of its organization; and (b) you are
duly authorized by such legal entity to act on its behalf.
You can only use our Services if permitted under the laws of your jurisdiction. Please make sure that these Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations that apply to you.
By using Trust Wallet, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements that we outline in these Terms. We may still refuse to let certain people access or use Trust Wallet, however, and we reserve the right to change our
eligibility criteria at any time.
</p>
<h3 class="font-weight-bold">THE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700">Trust Wallet is software that (a) generates Wallet addresses and encrypted private keys that you may use to send and receive Ethereum and related cryptographically secured tokens (the “Virtual Currency”); (b) allows users to browse third party
decentralized applications (“DApps” or “DApp”) through the mobile application’s DApp browser; and (c) facilitates the submission of Virtual Currency transaction data to Ethereum-based blockchains (the “Ethereum Networks”) without requiring you
to download or install the associated Ethereum-based software to your local device.
Wallet Address, Private Key, and Backup Capabilities. An encrypted backup of certain information associated with the Wallet can be stored on your device in Keystore JSON format. The private key is connected to the Wallet address and, together,
they can be used to authorize the transfer of Virtual Currency to and from that Wallet address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. You must
keep your Wallet address, mnemonic (backup) phrase, and private key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Virtual Currency associated with the Wallet.
Trust Wallet Cannot Assist With Password Retrieval. Trust Wallet stores your Wallet address but does not receive or store your Wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your
Wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with Wallet password retrieval. We cannot generate a new password for your Wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet address and private
key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Virtual Currency you have associated with such a Wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password.
Virtual Currency Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency’s associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks
supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the Ethereum Networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our Services will be
confirmed and processed. By using Trust Wallet, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Ethereum Networks.
Trust Wallet Does Not Store or Transmit Virtual Currency. We do not store, send, or receive Virtual Currency. Any transfer that occurs in any Virtual Currency occurs on the Ethereum-based blockchains and not on a network owned by us. We
therefore do not guarantee that Trust Wallet can affect the transfer of title or right in any Virtual Currency.
Accuracy of Information Provided by User. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in
connection with any Virtual Currency transaction initiated via the Services. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a Virtual Currency.
</p>
<h3 class="font-weight-bold">WALLET REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700">You must either import or create a Wallet in order to use Trust Wallet. When you create a Wallet, you will be assigned a private key. You will be prompted to download and save a keystore - your private key encrypted with a password. You will be
responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your private key and keystore, and will be fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your
password, account, or any other breach of security.
We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this paragraph. When you create a Wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your Wallet.
Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) creating a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) using the backup functionality provided by the Wallet or safeguard your private
key and mnemonic (backup) phrase on an external hard drive which, all users, especially users who have more than $100,000 USD in assets, are encouraged to do even if they are utilizing the Services’ backup functionality; (c) maintaining the
security of your Wallet by protecting the private key and mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet by, for example, limiting access to your computer and your Wallet; and (d) promptly notifying us if you discover or otherwise suspect
any security breaches related to your Wallet.
Push Notifications. You may agree to receive push notifications from Trust Wallet that will alert you when Ethereum-based blockchains are congested and when transactions involving your Wallet have been completed. Push notifications can be
enabled to display information about Token Launches. If you would like to receive push notifications, you must opt in to the service by accessing “Settings” and enabling “Push Notifications”.
Payment and Fees. Trust Wallet does not currently charge any fees for any of its Services. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future and, in such case, any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any service to which a
fee applies.
Transactions. Once transaction details have been submitted via the Services, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. Trust Wallet has no control over any Ethereum-based blockchain and does not have the ability to
facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your Wallet and/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for
any failed transactions due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your Trust Wallet account.
Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions that you have submitted transaction details for via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate
tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Ethereum-based transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Virtual Currency-related
transactions.
</p>
<h3 class="font-weight-bold">THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND CONTENT</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700">In no event shall a description or reference to a third party’s product or service (including, but not limited to, providing a description or reference via hyperlink) be construed as an endorsement or promotion of such third party products or
services by us. We retain the exclusive right to add to, modify, or cancel the availability of any Third Party Service.
You may agree to receive push notifications from Third Party Content providers. In order to receive push notifications, you must opt in to the service. Push notifications will not be automatically enabled on your device for Third Party Content.
We do not control, endorse, or adopt any Third Party Content shared through push notifications, and will have no responsibility for Third Party Content including, but not limited to, token availability and/or sales.
If, to the extent permitted by Trust Wallet, you grant express permission to a third party to access or connect to your Trust Wallet account, either through the third party’s product or service or through Trust Wallet, you acknowledge that
granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement. You are fully responsible for all acts or omissions of any third party with access to your
Trust Wallet account.
